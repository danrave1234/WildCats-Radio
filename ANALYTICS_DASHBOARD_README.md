## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### 1. AnalyticsContext (`frontend/src/context/AnalyticsContext.jsx`)
- Manages analytics data state
- Fetches data from various API endpoints
- Processes and aggregates metrics
- Automatically refreshes data every 5 minutes

### Data Sources
The dashboard aggregates data from multiple sources:

- Engagement metrics from chat and song requests

### Security
Multiple layers of security ensure that only authorized users can access:
1. **Sidebar Navigation**: The "Analytics" link only appears for users with DJ or ADMIN roles
2. **Route Protection**: The route is protected with `allowedRoles={['DJ', 'ADMIN']}`
3. **Component-Level Check**: The component itself verifies user roles
