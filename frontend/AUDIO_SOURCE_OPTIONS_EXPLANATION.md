# Audio Source Options for DJ Broadcasting

## Current Implementation: Browser-Based Desktop Audio Capture

The current system uses the browser's **Screen Sharing API** with audio capture to get desktop audio. This is the most reliable and secure method for web applications.

### How It Works:
1. When you click "Select Source", the browser opens a dialog
2. You can choose from:
   - **Entire Screen** (captures all system audio)
   - **Application Window** (captures audio from a specific app)
   - **Browser Tab** (captures audio from a specific tab)

### Why This Approach:
- **Security**: Web browsers restrict direct access to system audio devices for security reasons
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **No additional software**: Built into modern browsers
- **DJ-friendly**: Perfect for capturing output from DJ mixer software

## Alternative Audio Source Options

### 1. Virtual Audio Cables (Recommended for DJs)
**Software like VB-Cable, VoiceMeeter, or OBS Virtual Audio:**
- Install virtual audio cable software
- Route your DJ mixer software output to the virtual cable
- Set the virtual cable as your system's default audio device
- The browser will capture this as "system audio"

### 2. Physical Audio Interface
**USB Audio Interfaces or Mixers:**
- Connect your DJ equipment to a USB audio interface
- The interface appears as an audio device in your system
- Route the interface output to your system audio
- Browser captures the mixed audio

### 3. DJ Software Integration
**Popular DJ Software Options:**
- **Serato DJ**: Route output to system audio or virtual cable
- **Virtual DJ**: Built-in broadcasting features or route to system audio
- **Traktor**: Audio routing to system or virtual audio device
- **rekordbox**: Output routing options

## Browser Limitations

### What the Browser CAN'T Do:
- Direct access to individual audio devices (microphones, line inputs)
- Bypass system audio routing
- Access hardware mixers directly
- Capture from specific audio interfaces without system routing

### What the Browser CAN Do:
- Capture system audio (whatever is playing through your speakers)
- Capture specific application audio
- Capture browser tab audio
- High-quality audio streaming (up to 48kHz, stereo)

## Recommended Setup for DJs

### Option 1: Virtual Audio Cable Setup
1. Install VB-Cable or VoiceMeeter
2. Set virtual cable as default audio device
3. Route DJ software output to virtual cable
4. Use browser's desktop audio capture
5. Monitor through headphones connected to DJ software

### Option 2: DJ Software Direct Output
1. Configure DJ software to output to system audio
2. Use separate audio interface for monitoring
3. Use browser's desktop audio capture
4. This captures the final mixed output

### Option 3: Hardware Mixer Setup
1. Connect DJ mixer to computer via USB or audio interface
2. Route mixer output to system audio
3. Use browser's desktop audio capture
4. Monitor through mixer's headphone output

## Why We Don't Show Individual Audio Devices

The current implementation focuses on desktop audio capture because:

1. **DJ Use Case**: DJs typically use mixer software that outputs to system audio
2. **Security**: Browsers restrict direct microphone access for privacy
3. **Quality**: Desktop audio capture provides the highest quality for mixed audio
4. **Simplicity**: One-click solution that works with any DJ setup
5. **Compatibility**: Works with all DJ software and hardware configurations

## Troubleshooting Audio Source Issues

### If "No Audio Source Connected" Still Shows:
1. Ensure you selected a source with audio in the browser dialog
2. Check that your DJ software is actually playing audio
3. Verify system audio is not muted
4. Try refreshing the page and selecting the source again
5. Check browser permissions for screen sharing

### For Better Audio Quality:
1. Use 48kHz sample rate in your DJ software
2. Ensure system audio is set to high quality
3. Close unnecessary applications to reduce CPU load
4. Use wired internet connection for streaming
