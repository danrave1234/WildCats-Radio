# WildCats Radio - Streaming Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Broadcast Disconnection on Page Refresh/Navigation

**Problem**: DJ dashboard would automatically end broadcasts when refreshing the page or switching between pages.

**Root Causes**:
- App.jsx was using dynamic `key={getRoutePath()}` for ProtectedRoute components, causing them to unmount/remount on navigation
- DJDashboard cleanup effect was automatically stopping broadcasts on component unmount
- No proper state persistence for broadcast sessions

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Removed Problematic Route Keys
**File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- Removed `key={getRoutePath()}` from all ProtectedRoute components
- This prevents unnecessary component unmounting during navigation

#### B. Updated DJDashboard Cleanup Logic
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/DJDashboard.jsx`
- Modified cleanup useEffect to only close WebSocket connections, not stop broadcasts
- Broadcast state now persists through the global StreamingContext
- Component unmounting no longer automatically ends broadcasts

#### C. Enhanced StreamingContext State Persistence
**File**: `frontend/src/context/StreamingContext.jsx`
- Added page visibility API handling to maintain connections when tab becomes inactive
- Enhanced broadcast state restoration when navigating back to dashboard
- Added beforeunload warning for active broadcasts
- Improved WebSocket connection management with better reconnection logic

### 2. Audio Format Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: Browser throwing "NotSupportedError: The element has no supported sources" when trying to play OGG format streams.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend serves streams as `/live.ogg` (Ogg Vorbis format)
- Not all browsers support OGG format natively (especially Safari, Edge on Windows)
- No fallback formats provided

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced Audio Format Fallback System
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/ListenerDashboard.jsx`
- Implemented sequential URL testing with multiple format fallbacks:
  1. Original URL (`.ogg`)
  2. URL without extension
  3. MP3 fallback (`.mp3`)
  4. AAC fallback (`.aac`)
- Added 5-second timeout per URL attempt
- Improved error handling with specific browser compatibility messages

#### B. Improved StreamingContext Audio Handling
**File**: `frontend/src/context/StreamingContext.jsx`
- Enhanced `startListening()` function with format fallbacks
- Added proper CORS configuration for external streams
- Improved error event handling with format detection
- Better audio restoration logic with fallback support

#### C. User-Friendly Error Messages
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/ListenerDashboard.jsx`
- Added comprehensive error message component
- Provides specific troubleshooting steps for format issues
- Guides users to compatible browsers and solutions

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Better WebSocket Management
- Prevented duplicate connections with proper state checking
- Added reconnection jitter to prevent simultaneous reconnects
- Improved connection lifecycle management

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery
- Format-specific error handling and fallbacks
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed connections
- Better debugging with detailed console logging

### 3. State Persistence
- Broadcast state survives page refreshes and navigation
- Audio preferences persist across sessions
- Proper cleanup only on user-initiated actions

## Testing Recommendations

### For DJ Functionality:
1. Start a broadcast
2. Refresh the page - broadcast should continue
3. Navigate to different pages - broadcast should persist
4. Only "End Broadcast" button should stop the broadcast

### For Listener Functionality:
1. Try playing stream in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
2. Test with and without internet connectivity issues
3. Verify fallback format loading works
4. Check error messages are helpful and actionable

## Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported:
- Chrome (all platforms)
- Firefox (all platforms)
- Edge (Windows/Mac)

### Limited Support:
- Safari (may have OGG issues, fallbacks should work)
- Mobile browsers (depends on codec support)

## Future Enhancements

### Backend Improvements:
1. Configure Icecast to serve multiple format endpoints (MP3, AAC, OGG)
2. Add stream transcoding for better browser compatibility
3. Implement adaptive bitrate streaming

### Frontend Improvements:
1. Add audio codec detection
2. Implement HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) support
3. Add stream quality selection for users

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Removed problematic route keys
2. `frontend/src/pages/DJDashboard.jsx` - Updated cleanup logic
3. `frontend/src/context/StreamingContext.jsx` - Enhanced state persistence and audio handling
4. `frontend/src/pages/ListenerDashboard.jsx` - Improved audio format fallbacks and error handling

These fixes ensure that broadcasts persist across page navigation and provide better audio compatibility across different browsers and platforms.
