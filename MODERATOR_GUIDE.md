# WildCats Radio - Moderator Guide

## 1. Moderation Philosophy
We aim to keep the chat safe and welcoming. Our system uses a mix of automated filtering and manual oversight.

## 2. Automated System
The system automatically detects profanity and applies tiers:
- **Tier 1 (Soft)**: Message is censored ("CITU TOPS AGAIN!"). No penalty.
- **Tier 2 (Harsh)**: Message censored. User receives **Strike 1 (Warning)**.
- **Tier 3 (Slurs)**: Message censored. User receives **Strike 2 (24h Ban)** or **Strike 3 (7-Day Ban)**.

### Strike Ladder
- **Strike 1**: Warning.
- **Strike 2**: 24-hour chat ban.
- **Strike 3**: 7-day chat ban. (User can appeal).

## 3. Moderator Tools
Access the **Moderator Dashboard** to:
- **Monitor Chat**: Watch live broadcasts.
- **Delete Messages**: Click delete on offensive messages. This action is logged.
- **Manage Users**: Change roles (Listener -> DJ). *Note: Admins manage Moderators.*
- **Profanity Dictionary tab**: View the list of banned words. Admins can add/remove words and set tiers; moderators/DJs can view. Tiers drive auto-actions (Tier 1 censor, Tier 2 warn, Tier 3 strike/ban).

## 4. Handling Appeals
Go to the **Appeals** tab in your dashboard.
1. View the list of **Pending Appeals**.
2. Expand "Strike History Snapshot" to see why they were banned.
3. Click **Approve** (lifts ban) or **Deny** (keeps ban).
4. Add internal notes if needed.
5. Your decision is logged in the system for audit.

## 5. Exports
When exporting a broadcast chat log, you will now see additional sheets:
- **Strikes**: Who got struck and why.
- **Moderator Actions**: Log of deletions and manual bans.
- **Analytics**: Demographics and engagement stats.
